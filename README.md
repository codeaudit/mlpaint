# MLPaint: the Real-Time Handwritten Digit Recognizer

MLPaint is an MLDB.ai plugin that does real-time handwritten digit recognition. The plugin was trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The WebUI allows a user to draw digits and receive real-time predictions as to what digit it most likely is. On top of that, the plugin displays the *explain matrix*, showing the user why the model made the prediction it made. MLPaint is a great example of white-box machine learning.
